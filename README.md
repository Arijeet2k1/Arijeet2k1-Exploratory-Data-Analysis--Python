## Project Summary and Objective 🎯
A new smartphone manufacturing company aims to enter the competitive smartphone market.The goal is to understand current market trends and preferences to offer smartphones with desirable specifications at competitive prices. The company seeks insights into key specifications that drive consumer preferences and pricing strategies based on existing market data. Hence I have prepared a cleaned dataset with the objective of performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on all columns to derive meaningful insights from the data and identify patterns.

**File 2** - Here I have done Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the complex data, identifying patterns through univariate and bivariate analysis. By analyzing correlations between columns, I determined positive and negative relationships, allowing for meaningful insights to be drawn from the data.
