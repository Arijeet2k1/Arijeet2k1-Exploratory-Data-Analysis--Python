**File 2** - Here I have conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to identify patterns within the dataset. Using visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, I have created various plots including bar plots, histograms, KDE plots, pie charts, scatter plots, and box plots. These visualizations have made it easier to understand the complex data, allowing for more effective communication of the insights derived from the analysis.
