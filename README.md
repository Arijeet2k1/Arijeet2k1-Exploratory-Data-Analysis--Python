Project Summary :- I have prepared a cleaned dataset with the objective of performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on all columns. My goal is to derive meaningful insights from the data and identify correlations between numerical columns to gain a comprehensive statistical understanding of the dataset.

File 1 - This is the cleaned dataset which I am using in my EDA process.

File 2 - Here I have conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to identify patterns within the dataset. Using visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, I have created various plots including bar plots, histograms, KDE plots, pie charts, scatter plots, and box plots. These visualizations have made it easier to understand the complex data, allowing for more effective communication of the insights derived from the analysis.

File 3 - This image showcases a dynamic Power BI dashboard with multiple graphs, simplifying data understanding and enhancing decision-making processes.
